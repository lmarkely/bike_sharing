## Project: Predicting Bike Sharing Rides

This project is part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. The goal of this project is to build a neural network to predict bike sharing rides based on historical data. The code for the neural network is in `my_answers.py`, and the project report is provided in `bike_sharing.ipynb`.
